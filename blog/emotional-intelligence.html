        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the ability to notice, understand, and
          manage our own feelings, as well as recognize and respond to the
          feelings of others.

        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          IQ is about thinking skills, problem solving, and logic. EQ is about
          people skills, self-awareness, and managing emotions. Both are useful,
          but they focus on different areas.

        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>
          EQ helps us work well with others, handle stress, and build stronger
          relationships. In jobs and everyday life, high EQ often makes a bigger
          difference than high IQ.
