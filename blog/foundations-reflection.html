      <h1>Foundations — Human Skills Reflection</h1>

      <h2>Journal prompt</h2>
      <p>

          >What surprised me the most about the Human Skills learning is...</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I was surprised how much practising small things, like a short
        mindfulness break or better listening. This actually changes how I work
        and feel. I expected human skills to be a little add-on, but they made
        technical tasks easier because I could focus better and ask for help
        more clearly.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>

      <h3>Three new things I learned about myself and my ego</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>I need time to understand things well.</strong> I learned that
          taking an extra minute or two to re-read concepts helps me build solid
          knowledge rather than rushing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>My shyness affects asking for help.</strong> I sometimes
          hesitate to speak up when there are many people, so I need to practice
          asking for help early and in small steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I feel proud when I fix my own mistakes.</strong> Going back
          over my code and finding the error makes me more confident and patient
          with my learning process.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>
        Role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning & programming
      </h3>
      <p>
        Values guide the choices I make (how I treat teammates, what I
        prioritise). Empathy helps me understand other people's ideas and
        communicate clearly. Self-awareness helps me recognise when I'm stuck,
        tired, or stressed and take the right break or ask for help. Together
        they make group work smoother and learning faster.
      </p>

      <h3>What surprised me most</h3>
      <p>
        That practicing simple habits (5 minutes of mindful breathing, or a
        structured listening loop) actually made me less reactive and more able
        to focus on hard problems.
      </p>

      <h3>Most challenging parts of Human Skills</h3>
      <p>
        The hardest part for me was actually doing the practices consistently
        (mindfulness every day) and being brave enough to ask for help in front
        of a group. I’m shy when many people are around.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Human Skills in a coding bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>
        Technical skill gets you a job; human skills help you keep it and grow
        in a team. Employers value teamwork, communication, leadership and the
        ability to manage stress, all are built by Human Skills practice. For
        me, they help me learn faster and make me a better teammate.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Was this time a waste? Should I have used it to practise code instead?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Not a waste. The Human Skills time would be an investment. After
        practising these skills I would be able to focus, communicate, and
        recover from stress better which would make my coding time more
        efficient. Doing both (human skills + coding) would be the best
        approach.
      </p>

      <h2>Short action plan</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Daily: 5-minute mindfulness after breakfast (or a short walk when
          stressed).
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask for help early: message a classmate or facilitator; if in a group,
          ask one person privately first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Weekly: 20 minutes on Sundays to update the Learning Plan and reflect
          on progress.
        </li>
      </ul>
