      <h2>Identity & Values</h2>
      <h3>Ethical Decision</h3>
      <p>
        During a university team project, one of my teammates was not
        participating as expected. Instead of ignoring the issue, I reached out
        to him to understand why. I discovered that he was unsure of what to do
        and was too shy to contact the lecturer for guidance. I decided to guide
        him step by step on what needed to be done and how to improve his part.
        By supporting him, our team was able to complete the project
        successfully. This experience taught me the importance of empathy, clear
        communication, and taking ethical responsibility to help others when
        challenges arise
      </p>
      <h3>Culture & Influence</h3>
      <p>
        Growing up in Korea has shaped who I am today. I learned the importance
        of respect, family, and community from a young age. Korean culture
        values hard work and perseverance, which helps me stay focused when
        facing challenges. Watching my parents and elders taught me patience,
        humility, and the importance of helping others. These lessons guide how
        I make decisions, work with people, and take responsibility in both my
        personal life and learning.
      </p>
      <h3>Strengths & Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        One of my strengths is that I always make sure I fully understand the
        content before moving on. This helps me build a strong foundation and
        ensures I don’t miss important details. However, English is my second
        language, so sometimes I find it hard to communicate my thoughts in
        depth. I also feel a bit shy when asking for help, especially in group
        settings. These challenges mean I sometimes take longer to clarify
        things, but they also push me to be patient, reflective, and careful in
        my learning. By recognizing these limitations, I can plan ahead, ask for
        help when needed, and collaborate more effectively with others.
      </p>
      <h3>Teamwork & Tension</h3>
      <p>
        I think in a team environments, disagreements are normal. For example,
        during a project, my peer and I had different ideas about how to
        approach a task. Instead of insisting on my own way, we asked the
        lecturer and teaching assistant for guidance on the best approach. By
        considering their feedback, we adjusted our work to meet the
        expectations and successfully completed the project. This experience
        taught me the importance of listening, seeking guidance when needed, and
        being flexible. In the future, I would continue to communicate openly
        and involve others when disagreements arise to ensure the team works
        effectively together.
