      <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>

      <h3>Long-term Goal / Career Pathway</h3>
      <p>
        At the moment, I am still exploring my career path and figuring out
        exactly what I want to do. I have a small interest in game development,
        but I am not completely certain if this is the direction I want to
        pursue long-term. I see this learning journey at Dev Academy as an
        opportunity to explore different areas in technology and discover what
        truly excites me, while building foundational skills that will help me
        in any future career.
      </p>

      <h3>Strengths and Limitations in Learning</h3>
      <p>
        One of my learning strengths is that I take the time to fully understand
        a concept before moving on. This ensures that I build a solid foundation
        and really understand the material. However, I tend to learn a bit
        slower than others, so it might take me a few minutes to understand
        something that others pick up quickly. This can be challenging when
        working within tight time frames, but I try to manage it by focusing,
        being patient with myself, and asking for clarification when needed.
      </p>

      <h3>Skills I Want to Develop</h3>
      <p>
        I want to focus on improving my teamwork and communication skills.
        Working effectively with others and sharing ideas clearly are essential
        for success in both learning and professional environments. By
        practicing collaboration in projects and being more confident in
        expressing my thoughts, I hope to strengthen these skills and contribute
        more effectively to group work.
      </p>

      <h3>Commitment to Workload</h3>
      <p>
        I plan to divide my study and project time into daily hours, so I can
        stay organized and focused. I will also make sure to seek help when I
        need it, whether from my peers, facilitators, or other support
        resources, to stay on track and keep learning effectively.
      </p>

      <h3>Working with Others</h3>
      <p>
        I will work productively and safely with others by collaborating
        respectfully and listening to different perspectives. When I am stuck or
        unsure about something, I will ask questions politely to peers,
        facilitators, or industry representatives. This approach will help me
        contribute effectively to group work while maintaining a positive and
        supportive learning environment.
      </p>

      <h3>Handling Stress</h3>
      <p>
        When I start feeling stressed or overwhelmed, I take time to listen to
        music, go for a hike, or meet with friends. These activities help me
        relax, recharge, and regain focus so I can continue my work productively
        and maintain a positive mindset.
      </p>

      <h3>Seeking Help</h3>
      <p>
        I will reach out to a classmate or ask a facilitator for guidance. By
        seeking assistance in a timely way, I can clarify my doubts quickly,
        stay on track with my learning, and avoid falling behind on tasks or
        projects.
      </p>

      <h3>Expectations of the Facilitation Team</h3>
      <p>
        I expect the facilitation team to provide clear guidance and timely,
        constructive feedback. This support will help me understand concepts
        more effectively and improve my skills.
      </p>

      <h3>Scheduling / Commitments</h3>
      <p>
        I have commitments on weekends, so I will plan my study and project work
        around them to make sure I stay on track.
