      <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3>What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result
        of experience. It means our brains are not fixed at birth but are
        malleable and constantly reshaping through our daily activities. This
        process helps us learn new skills, recover from injuries, and adapt to
        new environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Why is Neuroplasticity Important?</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding neuroplasticity benefits us by showing that we can improve
        our abilities through practice, learning, and new experiences. It
        encourages a growth mindset—believing that intelligence and skills can
        develop over time.
      </p>

      <h3>Connecting to Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding neuroplasticity supports the idea that effort and
        persistence lead to growth. Embracing this can help you stay motivated
        and resilient in your learning journey.
