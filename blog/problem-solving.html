      <h2>Problem Solving Reflection</h2>

      <h3>A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> I was trying to understand how to write a
        function that takes a number as a parameter and returns different
        strings based on whether the number is divisible by 3, 5, or 15. The
        code looked something like this.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Techniques used:</strong> At first, I googled the code to try
        and understand how it works. I didn’t fully understand it initially, so
        I used AI assistance to help me break down the logic. It helped me
        understand that the % operator checks and how the function returns
        different strings based on that. Still, I feel I need more time and
        practice to fully understand it
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Feelings:</strong> I felt confused and a bit overwhelmed at
        first. When I used AI to help, I felt a little more confident, but I
        know I need to spend more time practicing these concepts. It was a
        reminder that learning programming takes patience and persistence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Lesson learned:</strong> I learned that it’s okay to seek help,
        whether from Google or AI tools. Also, I realized that understanding the
        logic behind functions takes time, and breaking down complex code into
        smaller parts helps me learn better.
      </p>

      <h3>Confidence in problem-solving techniques</h3>
      <p>
        I feel most confident using console.log to debug and googling for
        solutions. Pseudocode is helpful but sometimes I skip it, which makes
        solving harder
      </p>

      <h3>Reluctance to ask for help</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes I hesitate to ask because I feel I should figure it out on my
        own. Next time, I will remind myself that asking is okay and can save
        time.
